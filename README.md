# Online Retail Store Database

The aim of this project is to design a database server for an online retail store. The idea to write queries to create required tables, add data into them and functions to perform basic tasks. Also, I have used stored procedures and triggers for adding other functionalities. Will work on improving the server and add more functionlities using PostgreSQL.
